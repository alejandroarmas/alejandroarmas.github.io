## EXPERIENCE


### Ground Software Engineer Intern | Aug 2022 – Nov 2022
##### [Astranis Space Technologies](https://www.astranis.com) | San Francisco, CA

- Improved low-latency microservice architecture, reducing satellite noise by 27%, leveraging customer centric mindset in redesign of the Flask backend, React front-end framework, and proprietary stream processor using Elasticsearch within agile team.
- Proactively identified technical debt and resolving critical issues in Kubernetes deployments, enabling the system to recover and restart several minutes faster potentially preventing multi-million dollar satellite crashes.

### Software Developer Intern | Mar 2021 – Nov 2021
##### [Exploratory Systems Laboratory](https://resilientdb.com/#team) | Davis, CA

- Created the ResilientBlog and authored the first 6 out of 33 articles on distributed systems, which reduced colleague onboarding time from months to weeks. My efforts were pivotal during the Apache incubation process and resulted in ResilientDB receiving **112 stars** and **196 forks** — https://go.alejandroarmas.dev/tU0gVJi

### Research Scientist Intern | May 2020 - Aug 2020 
##### [Massachusetts Institute of Technology - Biology Summer Research Program](https://biology.mit.edu/program-details-bsg-msrp-bio/) | Remote, CA
- Contributed to ML research by deliverying presentation on state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms that learned from reward distributions instead of expected values by reviewing academic literature, proving theorems, and implementing algorithms using Numpy and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. — https://go.alejandroarmas.dev/UrXJtxv

### Intern - Interdisciplinary and Quantitative Biology REU |  Jun. 2019 - Aug. 2019 
##### [Universidad de Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras](https://iqbioreu.uprrp.edu/index.php/2019-cohort/) | San Juan, Puerto Rico
- Automated human categorization of bee experiments with k-means clustering solution using R, tidyr, and tibble
- Communicated weekly to **20+** stakeholders representing 4 teams by creating visualizations with ggplot2. Findings accepted at ABRCMS conference— https://go.alejandroarmas.dev/FUoMsov
## PROJECTS

### Traffic Prediction Service (Request Access for View) | May 2023 - Present
**Tech: Ray, Docker, Terraform, DVC, S3, ONNX, Plotly**
- Streamlined team decision-making by building a cloud experimentation solution, secured by AWS IAM roles/policies, then optimized dataset network transmissions by **35x** leveraging DVC, S3, Docker, Terraform, Poetry and Parquet — go.alejandroarmas.dev/qKDhGU2, go.alejandroarmas.dev/LkQpB2H
- Improved ML model by reducing feature latency from 36 hours to 30-seconds by building a pipeline processing **83K** records/s with Apache Flink, then reduced storage by **70%** using serialization and compaction.
- Identified and drove technical requirements insights for an online feature big-data architecture by deeply engaging with unstructured data using GroundingDINO, SAM, DPT, Plotly, OpenCV and CoTracker — https://go.alejandroarmas.dev/RXsjI5F
    
### [some-dl-models](https://github.com/alejandroarmas/some-dl-models) | Jan 2023 - Apr 2023
**Tech: PyTorch, comet ml, Poetry, ONNX, Github Actions**
- Designed and implemented CI/CD pipeline that automated training artifact captures and visualizations saving team **~100 hours** of productivity in implementing MLP, CNN, RNN, and GNN models using comet-ml, Poetry, static-analysis, unit-testing, and GitHub Actions — go.alejandroarmas.dev/7hP863H

### [MLOPS Question + Answer Bot](https://alejandroarmas.github.io/post/sf-llm-stack-hackathon/) | Mar 2023 - Mar 2023
**Tech: Relevence AI, Redis, OpenAI**
- Implemented Vector Search in Q/A Bot and contributed to team being awarded **Top 3** at MLOps.community LLM SF Hackathon leveraging Redis and OpenAI APIs — go.alejandroarmas.dev/VstnG18

### [Automatic Differentiation Backpropagation Engine](https://github.com/alejandroarmas/Wirikuta) | Dec. 2021 - Jun. 2022
**Tech: C++20, C++17, C++14, OpenCilk, doctest, Catch2**
-  Build Deep Learning framework which dynamically builds directed acyclic graphs of tensors and computational operations at runtime. Each node contains a statically built finite state automata, for traversal policies such as gradient descent.
-   Achieved **142x speedup** over naive Matrix Multiply and **10x speedup** on transpose operations by implementing Parallel Divide and Conquer algorithms and representing matrices in row-major order for reduced cache misses.

### [D-Cash Wallet Web Server](https://github.com/alejandroarmas/gunrock_web) |  May 2021 - Jun. 2021    
**Tech: C++, Stripe API, RapidJSON, POSIX threads, Git**
- Developed secure server wallet authentication, transfer, deposit, and charge issuance services, with integration of Stripe API.
- Implemented consumer-producer multi-threaded client request concurrent processing scheme to improve latency.


### Davis In-Order CPU | Mar 2021 - Jun 2021
**Tech: Chisel, Scala, RISC-V, Python, Pandas and Matplotlib**
- Developed a comprehensive RV32I Pipelined CPU design using Chisel HDL, incorporating several functional units such as Branch Predictor, Hazard Unit, Forwarding Unit, ALU, ALU Control Unit, and Control Unit.
- Conducted extensive simulations and analysis comparing the performance of single-cycle and pipelined designs. Utilized four different branch predictors and varied saturation bits over six workloads to create detailed visualizations.

### [Lineage-based Data Store](https://github.com/p3terlo/lstore_db) | Jan 2021 - Apr 2021
