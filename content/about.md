### Hey Whats Up! I'm Alejandro Armas

I am a recent graduate at the *University of California, Davis* interested in building ML platforms (anything related to training, deploying, monitoring ML models or collecting/transforming big-data).

> I hope that this blog can prove to be useful for helping others digest complicated topics. Furthermore, my intention to pursue leading industry roles and teaching, is to lead and advance this emerging field to become more inclusive, so we can develop more diverse participation in engineering with science education. If you'd like to see more of my professional experience (*or hire me*!), make sure to check out the [**Resume tab**](/resume/). This webpage is meant to show I am more than an academic in spite of how passionate I am of science. 


Since you've gotten this far, I'm going to share in confidence my favorite equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
$$


#### Gym-Life

I love going to the gym. It used to not be that way. In fact, the majority of my life I coped with food, due to the environment I grew up around. Then, I decided I wanted something different.

Once I found the gym, my confidence grew tremendously. Now it is my lifestyle to become the healthiest version of myself. 

In fact, I used to weigh over 220lbs, now I weigh 170 ðŸ¤© I love talking gym and if you do, then hit me up!!
