### Hey Whats Up! I'm Alejandro Armas


I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong interest in infrastructure and platforms.

When my parents were my age, they left a poor village in Mexico, so that I could be the first in my family to have a Bsc. in Computer Science at UC Davis. I have worked at four internships:

1. My first was an NSF-funded REU in Puerto Rico, where I translated research needs of users into an ML solution. 
2. Interning At MIT, I delved into cutting-edge ML algorithms, presenting my findings and leveraging frameworks like PyTorch.
3. Next, I was at the ExpoLab working on a big-data architecture, where I reduced colleague onboarding time from months to weeks by creating the ExpoBlog. 
4. At a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz, my coding expertise contributed to enhancing software services and averting potential multi-million dollar satellite crashes. 
5. Most recently, under the guidance of an industry leader with nine years of experience, I deployed and optimized cloud ML infrastructure by 35x. This enhancement enabled me to analyze datasets effectively, driving the design and construction of a real-time ML feature pipeline with monitoring capabilities. Consequentially I achieved a 8-fold increase in scalability, laying the groundwork for the eventual productization of the ML model.

While my technical achievements are noteworthy, my true pride lies in honoring my motherâ€™s legacy of hard work and support. As a mentor with Close The Gap, I extend that legacy, guiding underrepresented students toward fulfilling careers in tech.

I am excited about the prospect of joining my next company, where I can merge my technical skills with a heartfelt commitment to building a safe, reliable, and inclusive data-driven product.


Since you've gotten this far, I'm going to share in confidence my favorite equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
$$


#### Gym-Life

I love going to the gym. It used to not be that way. In fact, the majority of my life I coped with food, due to the environment I grew up around. Then, I decided I wanted something different.

Now it is my lifestyle to become the healthiest version of myself. 

In fact, I used to weigh over 220lbs, now I weigh 170 ðŸ¤© I love talking gym and if you do, then hit me up!!
