### Hey Whats Up! I'm Alejandro Armas


I am a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong interest in infrastructure and platforms.

When my parents were my age, they left a village in Mexico, so that my siblings and I could seize the American Dream. I'm the first in my family to have a Bsc. in Computer Science at UC Davis. I have worked at four internships:

1. My first was an NSF-funded REU in Puerto Rico, where I translated research needs of users into an ML solution. 
2. Interning At MIT, I delved into cutting-edge ML algorithms, presenting my findings and leveraging frameworks like PyTorch.
3. Next, I was at the ExpoLab working on a big-data architecture, where I reduced colleague onboarding time from months to weeks by creating the ExpoBlog. 
4. At a startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz, my coding expertise contributed to enhancing software services and averting potential multi-million dollar satellite crashes. 
5. Most recently, under the guidance of an industry leader with nine years of experience, I deployed and optimized cloud ML infrastructure by 35x. This enhancement enabled me to analyze datasets effectively, driving my design and construction of a real-time ML feature pipeline which efficiently processed 83K records/s with monitoring capabilities. My three contributions ultimately laying the groundwork for the eventual productization of an ML model.

While my technical achievements are noteworthy, my true pride lies in honoring my familyâ€™s legacy of hard work and support. That's why I created this blog!

As a mentor with Close The Gap, I extend that legacy to fulfill a lifelong dream, guiding underrepresented students toward fulfilling careers in tech.

Right now, I am excited about the prospect of joining my next company, where I can merge my technical skills with a heartfelt commitment to building a safe, reliable, and inclusive data-driven product.


Since you've gotten this far, I'm going to share in confidence my favorite equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
$$


#### Gym-Life

I love going to the gym. It used to not be that way. In fact, the majority of my life I didn't understand what effect the food I ate had on me. My diet consisted of doritos, gogurt, and frosted flakes to name a few. I think it made me happy in the moment. One day the flip switched and I wanted something different.

Now it is my lifestyle to become the healthiest version of myself. 

If you're on the fence about fitness, consider the following:
- I used to weigh over 220lbs, now I weigh 170 ðŸ¤© 
- I'm a happier person
- I'm proud of my strength. It feels awesome to lift weights!
- If I can do it, you can do it!

I love talking gym and if you do, then hit me up!!
