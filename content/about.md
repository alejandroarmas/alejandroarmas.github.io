I am a recent graduate at the *University of California, Davis* interested in building data-driven products (as in training, deploying, monitoring ML models). 

> I hope that this blog can prove to be useful for helping others digest complicated topics. Furthermore, my intention to pursue leading industry roles and teaching, is to lead and advance this emerging field to facilitate inclusive minority and women participation in engineering with science education. If you'd like to see more of my professional experience (*or hire me*!), make sure to check out the [**Resume tab**](/resume/). This webpage is meant to show I am more than an academic in spite of how passionate I am of science. 


Since you've gotten this far, I'm going to share in confidence my favorite equation:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
$$
